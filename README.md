## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

*   **Node.js**: This project uses Node.js (which includes npm). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). It's recommended to use the LTS version.
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn**: npm comes with Node.js. If you prefer Yarn, you can install it via `npm install -g yarn`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-quize.git
    # Replace `your-username/python-quize` with the actual repository URL if different
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd python-quize
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    Use npm or Yarn to install the required packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This command will start the Next.js development server. You can then open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.
